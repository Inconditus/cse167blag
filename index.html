      <h2>Post 3: Final status report</h2>
      <div><i>06/06/16</i></div>
      <p>
Lots of progress is being made as we near the final hours for our project deadline. We've implemented full arrow key movement for our tank,
as well as WASD key movement for our camera. We've also created procedurally-modeled buildings, that change based off of psuedo-random seed. </p>
<p>We've also implemented bounding boxes and bullets and sound effects. Just have a few more features to implement before we're done.</p>

      <h2>Post 2: Progress on Tanky McTankface</h2>
      <div><i>06/03/16</i></div>
      <div>
      Here is the updated information about our project. Short summary: We 
      textured our Tanky and refactored our code.
      We have models for the terrain and our tiers for the
      buildings. We also worked on procedurally generating buildings.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Description: (EDITED)</b> Tanky McTankface is a <span class="strike">first-person</span> third-person point-of-view
        game where the player mans a tank to explore the procedurally generated
        city environment. The player will be able to shoot various objects and
        free-roam the city!
        </li>
        <li><b>Technical features: (CHANGED)</b>
          We've determined that these new features would match our project more.
          The terrain will be pre-defined as will the location for the buildings.
          However the buildings will have variation, with different tiers in
          different combinations. Plus we'll need bounding boxes if Tanky is
          to shoot anything.
          <ul>
            <li>Hard: Shadow mapping</li>
            <li>Medium: Procedural buildings, Bounding boxes/collision</li>
            <li>Easy (2 of these features): Sound effects, Glow (bloom), particle effects, per polygon texturing</li>
            <span class="strike">
              <li>Particle effect: some shooting here, some water there....</li>
              <li>Sound effects: Tanks make noise, and so do bullets.</li>
              <li>Procedurally modeled city: This is what Tanky rolls through.</li>
              <li>Procedurally modeled buildings: Tanky can shoot these.</li>
              <li>Shadow mapping</li>
            </span>
          </ul>
        </li>

          Look at our roof and window that will be used for our procedurally generated buildings!

        <li><b>Team name:</b> Emu-ji</li>
        <li><b>Description:</b> Tanky McTankface is a first-person point-of-view
        game where the player mans a tank to explore the procedurally generated
        city environment. The player will be able to shoot various objects and
        free-roam the city!

            <li>Sound effects: Tanks make noise, and so do bullets.</li>

            <li>Shadow mapping</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Creative efforts:</b> Our creative efforts will be in making a
        functional game (interactive!) with nice textures, lighting, buildings,
        and smooth controls.
        It will have both a shooter aspect and an open-world
        exploration aspect.

        character which stars in the game!
